Web app build with Javascript that lets children press a button to get an activity. When an activity
is accepted, they can then earn a star for completing chosen activity. An admin panel is also included for
managing the built-in activity list. 

Primary & secondary activities are currently being loaded in using a JSON file which then gets stored in localStorage.
